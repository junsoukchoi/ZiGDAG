```

The R package `ZiGDAG` implements zero-inflated generalized hypergeometric directed acyclic graphs (ZiG-DAGs) for inference of causal structure from observational zero-inflated count data. For the structure learning of ZiG-DAGs, score-based greedy search algorithms are implemented.

## Installation

To install the latest version from Github, use

```{r install, tidy = 'formatR', eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
