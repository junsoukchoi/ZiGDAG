ZiGDAG: R package for model-based causal discovery for zero-inflated
count data
================

-   <a href="#installation" id="toc-installation">Installation</a>

The R package `ZiGDAG` implements zero-inflated generalized
hypergeometric directed acyclic graphs (ZiG-DAGs) for inference of
causal structure from observational zero-inflated count data. For the
structure learning of ZiG-DAGs, score-based greedy search algorithms are
implemented.
